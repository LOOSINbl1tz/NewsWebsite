An exhaustive set of entertainment options. With it came the traffic snarls \u2014 on foot or car \u2014 from every road closure, redirection or new fencing erected along the Las Vegas Strip as part of construction preparations for a Formula One race that is still a month away. The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix, if nothing else, will be a sensory overload of neon bright lights, roaring race cars and some of the wealthiest F1 fans in the world in attendance. But the daily disruptions have created a vibe that the ballyhooed event might also be an expensive, logistical headache. American fans of the global racing series have grumbled since tickets went on sale that they\u2019ve been priced out of this year\u2019s third F1 stop in the United States. The race is being promoted by F1, which acknowledged last year that Las Vegas will be the most expensive spectator event on its 23-race calendar. The Wynn Grid Club offers a $50,000 package that includes, among other things, race tickets, a helicopter tour and transportation to the circuit. There is also the \u201copportunity\u201d to purchase a hot lap on the track and \u201caccess to five-star accommodations at Wynn Las Vegas.\u201d All the top hotels, charging pre-pandemic rates, have created F1 experiences that are catered to the very elite. Don\u2019t want to actually go to the track? For $7,000, you can hang out at Sports Illustrated Club SI and watch the action with David Beckham and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Several NASCAR drivers played tourist this past weekend and checked out the ongoing build of the 3.853-mile (6.20 kilometers), 17-turn course that starts in a parking lot and passes multiple Las Vegas attractions. It might be the closest they get to the event, which comes Nov. 18 \u2014 two weeks after the NASCAR season finale. \u201cI thought about it, but I\u2019m sure as everyone knows, it is going to be expensive,\u201d said playoff driver Tyler Reddick. \u201cWhen we landed, we drove right by it, and the amount of construction is insane \u2026 how much they\u2019ve already dug in and changed the appearance of the Strip for this event is pretty wild to see.\u201d It\u2019s going to be a party and that\u2019s evident by the start times all weekend. Qualifying begins at midnight, the race itself is 10 p.m. on Saturday. And the emphasis on everything not including the racing will be important because the race itself has almost nothing on the line. (Do tuck this away: there\u2019s already concern the late track times are going to make it difficult for drivers to warm their tires to suitable temperatures.) F1 expanded to three races in the U.S. this year, one of the most boring seasons in recent memory. Max Verstappen won the driver championship with six races remaining on the schedule, and Red Bull locked up the constructors title even earlier. Verstappen and Red Bull have won 16 of 17 races to date, and the outcomes have rarely been close. It\u2019s made for a disappointing season at a time when F1 had captured new American fans with an assist from the Netflix behind-the-scenes \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d docudrama. The only drama this season has been off the track. Sergio Perez, despite two wins at the start of the season, has been dominated by teammate Verstappen every session and rumors about his future have swirled for months. There have been reports that Perez has been told if he doesn\u2019t finish second to Verstappen in the standings then he will be fired, as well as speculation the Mexican will announce his F1 retirement during his home race weekend later this month. Logan Sargeant, the first American in the series since Alexander Rossi in 2015, has failed to create any buzz in his rookie season with Williams and the team has given him clear direction on the benchmarks he must hit to keep his seat in 2024. Then there\u2019s the entire Michael Andretti mess. He could find out this weekend at the U.S. Grand Prix in Texas if he\u2019s still the most unwelcome visitor in the F1 paddock. He wants an F1 team, applied to the FIA to be added to the grid, and F1\u2019s governing body at the start of the month approved Andretti Global as the only suitable applicant for expansion. Andretti, with a partnership with General Motors, must still convince Formula One Management to let him launch a team and the F1 response to Andretti Global\u2019s approval was tepid at best. \u201cWe note the FIA\u2019s conclusions in relation to the first and second phases of their process and will now conduct our own assessment of the merits of the remaining application,\u201d F1 said upon Andretti receiving FIA approval. Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions. Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. Just when F1 gets around to conducting its own assessment is anyone\u2019s guess. The juicy stuff will be happening inside the velvet ropes in Vegas, accessible only to the well-heeled and Netflix camera crews. The race down the Strip is exciting in concept and probably will be a smashing success for the international tourists looking for a good time at an F1 race. For the Americans? Save your money (if you could even afford it) and your sanity. All the highlights will be in Season 6 of \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d anyway. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing Advertisement Advertisement",

The Problem Child returns on December 15 under his Most Valuable promotions banner, to be aired on DAZN against an unnamed opponent.

Paul said in a statement: \"Eight fights in the boxing game and I\u2019m already its biggest name. I've proved that I can headline the biggest global events and defy the odds. \"PPV after PPV after PPV, and I\u2019m just getting started.

NEW YORK \u2013 Toronto centre Auston Matthews has been named the NHL\u2019s first star of its opening week of the 2023-24 season after he posted hat tricks in the Maple Leafs\u2019 first two games. Vancouver Canucks centre Elias Pettersson took second-star honours after posting a goal and five assists in two games, while Pittsburgh centre Evgeni Malkin was named third star with two goals and four assists in three games. Matthews became just the second player since the NHL\u2019s inaugural 1917-18 campaign to record a hat trick in each of his first two games of a season. He scored two of his three goals in the final five minutes of regulation to erase a two-goal deficit in Toronto\u2019s season-opening 6-5 shootout win over Montreal on Wednesday. Matthews followed that with three goals in a 7-4 win over Minnesota on Saturday. Pettersson opened the season with a goal and three assists in Vancouver\u2019s 8-1 rout of visiting Edmonton on Wednesday, and followed with two assists in the Canucks\u2019 4-3 win in Saturday\u2019s rematch in Edmonton.

But a new study confirms that a normal resting heart rate isn't the same for everyone. Data from over 92,000 FitBit-wearers were analyzed in a new PLOS ONE paper , showing that average resting heart rates ranged between 40 and 109 beats per minute (BPM). Though not all of those rates are necessarily healthy, the study did find that each individual\u2019s heart rate stayed fairly consistent over time. Monitoring your heart rate through devices like FitBit and understanding the various factors that can influence it has the potential to improve your long-term health. What Is a Resting Heart Rate? Resting heart rate (RHR) is a crucial health indicator that shows how many times your heart beats per minute when you're not active. It's a vital sign and can tell us about our overall health, the risk of various health issues, how fit we are, and how our body responds to exercise. RHR varies among individuals and can be influenced by many factors. However, there can be confusion in its definition and how it's measured, especially with the growing use of wearable devices for heart rate monitoring. It's important to have clear definitions and consistency in measuring RHR, especially as more people use these devices for health monitoring. Read More: What Does the Heart Do? What Is the Average Resting Heart Rate? A normal resting heart rate likely lies between 60 and 100 BPM, and might dip down to 40 in elite athletes. Generally, lower heart rates are a sign of better cardiovascular health. Recent research has suggested that a heart rate changing over time could also hint at other conditions happening in the body. For example, one study tracked the phases of menstrual cycles based on daily shifts in heart rate. The dataset for this study included people ages 18 to 100 with body mass index values between 15 and 50. The average user had a rate of 65 BPM, which fluctuated depending on factors such as sex, age, BMI, and how much sleep they had gotten. Data from individual users were stripped of identifying information. When Quer and his team studied the FitBit data \u2014 information that users consented to share \u2014 they confirmed much of what doctors already know about heart rates. What Is the Average Resting Heart Rate for Women and Men? The average resting heart rate for women can vary, but it typically falls within the range of 78 and 82 beats per minute. Women had higher average heart rates than men, and those who got a better night's sleep had lower resting heart rates. Individuals with a higher BMI typically had higher heart rates. But altogether, the factors the researchers were able to include only accounted for 10 percent of the difference in heart rate between people. The other 90 percent might be due to fitness or other factors the team didn\u2019t study, Quer says. The study also found that each person\u2019s heart rate was remarkably stable over time. Interestingly, women of childbearing age had heart rates that fluctuated the most . This might be related to heart rate changes through the menstrual cycle, Quer says. Read More: How a Heart Can Stop After a Forceful Impact How to Find the Resting Heart Rate You can easily find your resting heart rate manually or with a fitness tracker like a FitBit. Checking your resting heart rate is important because it can provide valuable insights into your overall health and fitness level. It serves as an indicator of how efficiently your heart is working, and any significant changes in your resting heart rate may signal underlying health issues. Manually You can measure your resting heart rate manually by placing your index and middle fingers on your non-dominant wrist, and feel for the pulses or beats. To measure your heart rate in beats per minute, you can count for a full 60 seconds. Electronically To measure your resting heart rate electronically, you can rely on a tracker and it should show around 85 percent of your maximum predicted heart rate. If your heart rate is consistently higher or lower than usual, consult your doctor. Read More: Is It Ever Too Late to Start Being Healthy? What Affects the Heart Rate? A variety of factors can influence a heart rate. Physical activity and exercise, as well as, medical conditions, such as asthma, high blood pressure, or high blood sugar associated with diabetes can impact the rate. Certain substances, like caffeine and alcohol, can also lead to changes in heart rate. Finally, external factors such as dehydration and smoking may contribute to fluctuations. Exercise Exercise , like endurance sports and yoga, can lower the resting heart rate, potentially benefiting those with high heart rates. Asthma Asthma can increase a heart rate due to low oxygen, high carbon dioxide and stress during an asthma attack. Blood Pressure Blood pressure influences the heart rate differently in different parts of the body, with a reverse relationship in central blood pressure and a positive correlation in peripheral blood pressure. High Blood Sugar High blood sugar is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes, particularly in individuals with high resting heart rates. Caffeine Caffeine can accelerate heart rate and lead to irregular heartbeats, especially in those consuming high-caffeine energy drinks. Alcohol Alcohol consumption may temporarily raise the heart rate, potentially causing tachycardia and, if frequent, more severe issues like heart failure and irregular rhythms. Smoking Smoking makes you breath in carbon monoxide, reducing available oxygen for red blood cells and causing the heart to beat faster to compensate and deliver more oxygen. Dehydration Dehydration can also impact the heart rate, leading to problems with blood pressure and body temperature regulation. Read More: Is 30 Minutes of Exercise a Day Enough? How to Lower Your Resting Heart Rate While certain medical conditions influence your resting heart rate, you can still take steps to lower it and enhance your overall health if it's higher than normal. Here are a few tips for lowering your resting heart rate: Get more exercise Reduce stress Quit smoking Stay hydrated Read More: Why Walking Might Be One of the Best Exercises For Health Why Do We Track Heart Rates? Tracking heart rates over time can be beneficial because it might give caregivers additional insights into their patients\u2019 lives. Other research has shown that a body fending off an infection , for example, or worsening asthma might result in a slight uptick in heart rate over a few weeks. In the future, tracking those minute changes over time might help alert doctors to what their patients are dealing with. For example, a fertility tracker could potentially be based off daily heart rate changes, Quer says, though it would take a lot more research to make that happen. How Can a Fit Bit Device Help Monitor Heart Rate? The data from a Fit Bit device could help users monitor their heart rate for any inconsistencies. If it\u2019s possible to track someone\u2019s heart rate continuously, then slight fluctuations in their individual pattern would reveal more about their well-being, said paper co-author Giorgio Quer, an artificial intelligence researcher at The Scripps Research Institute, in an email. \u201cInstead of focusing on a single measurement done in the clinic, it is now possible to have a longitudinal view of the changes in resting heart rate,\" Quer said. \"As we learn more, [regular heart rate monitoring could] provide information not only for cardiovascular health but also for pulmonary status, early infectious disease detection, reproductive health, and likely much more.\" Are There Any Limitations to the Heart Rate Study? There are a few limitations to the 2020 health rate study. Data from FitBits alone leaves out parts of the population that don\u2019t have the device. It's possible those who wear FitBits might look different from the population as a whole \u2014 they might exercise more, for example, or eat better diets. Additionally, the team didn\u2019t factor physical activity into their analysis. But Quer plans to dive into more of this data \u2014 even as he keeps his eye on his own. Quer said he wears two activity trackers 24/7 for a read on his own heart rate, sleep and activity levels. \u201cFor me, it is a great way to understand what is affecting me,\" he said. Read More: When Hearts Beat as One Resting Heart Rate FAQ: Why Is My Resting Heart Rate So High? Your resting heart rate could be high due to a wide range of factors. Physical activity and exercise have the potential to alter your heart rate. Moreover, underlying medical conditions, such as asthma or elevated blood sugar linked to diabetes can have an impact on heart rate. Certain substances, like caffeine and alcohol, are known to induce variations. Additionally, dehydration and smoking might also play a role in heart rate fluctuations. Does Blood Pressure Affect Your Heart Rate? The connection between heart rate and blood pressure varies depending on the specific location within the body. While there is a reverse relationship between heart rate and central blood pressure, there is a positive correlation between heart rate and peripheral blood pressure. How Does Exercise Affect Your Heart Rate? Exercise has a notable effect on heart rate, particularly the resting heart rate. For example, both endurance sports and yoga can lead to a reduction in RHR, which can be beneficial for individuals with high RHRs. Does High Blood Sugar Affect Your Heart Rate? Yes, there is an established connection between high blood sugar and heart rate. Healthy adults with high resting heart rates in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, had a 60 percent greater risk of developing diabetes than those with low resting heart rates. Does Dehydration Affect Your Heart Rate? Yes, dehydration can affect heart rate. Mild dehydration can also lead to issues related to blood pressure and body temperature regulation. To address mild dehydration, it is recommended to consume non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated fluids, such as water, sports drinks, fruit juices, tea, and non-caffeinated soda. How Does Alcohol Affect the Heart Rate? The consumption of alcohol can result in a temporary increase in your heart rate. If it surpasses 100 beats per minute, it may trigger a condition known as tachycardia. Experiencing frequent episodes of tachycardia could potentially lead to more severe problems, such as heart failure or the development of irregular heart rhythms, which in turn can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. How Does Caffeine Affect Your Heart Rate? Consuming high levels of caffeine can accelerate your heart rate. In some cases this can result in irregular heartbeat patterns like atrial fibrillation, particularly in individuals who consume energy drinks with exceptionally high caffeine content. Nevertheless, it's important to note that not everyone experiences these effects, and even individuals with underlying heart conditions may tolerate substantial caffeine intake without negative consequences. Does Asthma Affect Your Heart Rate? Yes, asthma can increase your heart rate for a few reasons. When you have low oxygen or too much carbon dioxide in your body, it can make your heart rate go up. Also, the stress from having an asthma attack can also make your heart beat faster. Finally, the medicine you use to treat asthma, called beta-2 agonists, can also affect your heart rate. How Does Smoking Affect Your Heart Rate? Smoking can increase your heart rate. If you are a smoker, you breathe in carbon monoxide, which reduces the amount of oxygen available for your red blood cells to transport throughout the body. This results in your heart getting less oxygen to pump to the body, which causes your heart to beat faster so you can get more oxygen.

The football heroes inspired her to raise money for an advanced bionic eye from America, which is not available on the NHS , for schoolgirl Myah Hauxwell. The nine-year-old from Mansfield, Nottingham was born with severe microphthalmia and became first person in the UK to undergo a revolutionary surgery to have a new eye created from her own stomach fat in 2018 at only three-years-old. Brave Myah has found confidence in football after being inspired by England's Lionesses to join her school's football team, with her favourite players including stars Jill Scott and goalie Mary Earps . Born with one eye as a result of her rare condition, Myah has had 24 surgeries procedures since birth, including the fitting of a prosthetic eye when she was just one-year-old; however, the weight of it caused one side of her face to collapse. Myah Hauxwell, 9, from Mansfield, Nottingham was born with severe microphthalmia Born with one eye as a result of her rare condition, Myah has had 24 surgeries procedures since birth Now her family is now appealing to raise \u00a315K for a bionic eye from the US that will help her confidence, after wearing a clear conformer - a plastic stent fitted into the eye socket that allows for optimal prosthetic results - due to unsuccessful operations that made her the subject of cruel bullying. Lauren said that representation was important for Myah to gain confidence, and football has been another outlet to build Myah's confidence. 'She's recently got into football now after watching the women's football, and I got her the goalie kit of Mary Earps, which she absolutely loves', said Lauren. 'Jill Scott is one of her favourite players, she absolutely loves her. 'Football helps her confidence because it's a contact sport, so she's getting confidence to be braver, to go in with tackles. 'She just loves being active, running about and enjoying being a kid. Myah plays football at her school football team, her mother Lauren described the benefits of football on Myah. 'She's seeing that women can do all the things that men do too', said Lauren. Nine-year-old Myah's favourite players including stars Jill Scott (pictured) and goalie Mary Earps The football heroes are helping to raise money for an advanced bionic eye from America, which is not available on the NHS, for schoolgirl Myah Hauxwell 'The magic moment for Myah, is when she is actually proud when she has her kit on and she comes off of the pitch and is red faced, and she's done it. 'She forgets what she's stressed about, what she's upset about. 'Her just coming off of the pitch and seeing that smile is all I ask for.' Microphthalmia, also known as small eye syndrome, is a condition that causes the eye to not develop during pregnancy. This condition is rare, with approximately 30 babies being born with this condition in the UK every year. Myah also suffered has multiple scars on her stomach from skin grafts in operations that have severely impacted Myah's mental health, so much so that she doesn't like to leave the house for fear of people seeing her. Myah also suffered has multiple scars on her stomach from skin grafts in operations that have severely impacted Myah's mental health Myah became first person in the UK to undergo a revolutionary surgery to have a new eye created from her own stomach fat in 2018 at only three-years-old Her mother Lauren, an aesthetician, is now speaking out to raise awareness of the effect that bullying has on children with visible differences. Myah has recently experienced aggressive bullying that has gotten worse in the last year and a half at her school. 'She receives daily comments about her eye,' said Lauren. 'Walking into a supermarket, people break their necks to look at Myah, and kids say 'oh look she's only got one eye'.' 'She hasn't currently got a temporary eye in, so it looks like she doesn't have an eye there. Myah was given a prosthetic eye when she was just one-year-old; however, the weight of it caused one side of her face to collapse 'One child said 'I'm gonna kick you in your face and break your glasses'. 'People have just said to her, 'You're ugly'. 'As the kids are getting older, Myah realises what they're actually saying to her, before she didn't know what they meant but now she knows.' Her mum is currently running a fundraiser to help raise \u00a315,000 for Myah to receive a state of the art bionic prosthetic eye in America, since her confidence has been affected after being bullied for how she looks. Myah has been offered prosthetic eyes on the NHS but they are basic and are only a temporary solution for Myah. 'The NHS provides eyes but they're not bionic, and are very basic' Her surgeries have ranged from, expanders to expand the eye socket, the microphthalmic eye fully removed, skin grafts, fat grafts, granulomas removed, and debulking of her eye socket 'The person we are seeing in America is the only one who does the bionic eye, it's unique because it has a chip in it which reacts to sunlight, so the pupil moves and dilates. 'Given everything that Myah has gone through I want the best for her.' Her surgeries have ranged from, expanders to expand the eye socket, the microphthalmic eye fully removed, skin grafts, fat grafts, granulomas removed, and debulking of her eye socket. 'Every time she has a surgery she either has a black eye or stitches in her face', said Lauren. 'When she has a fat graft or skin graft her eye goes shocking white, because the blood has to attach to the new skin, so she looks very different and kids at school have bullied her for that.' Brave Myah has found confidence in football after being inspired by England's Lionesses to join her school's football team Myah is learning to ignore the bullying now, but she struggled a lot when it started. 'She would hit herself out of frustration because people were so mean to her', said her mother. 'She would say to me that nobody liked her and she wanted to be 'normal'. 'She didn't want to leave the house at one point because people would look at her on the street.' Lauren has had numerous meetings with the school to put procedures in place to support Myah. Myah has recently experienced aggressive bullying that has gotten worse in the last year and a half at her school. 'As many times a day as I try to tell her she's beautiful and perfect, it's not enough', said Lauren. 'She needs other people to be kind to her. Myah now has better ways to cope with the bullying, through support from her mother and counselling from a local charity, The Lashes Foundation, she does drawing tasks which helps get her anger out on paper. 'We do some arts and crafts together or go on a bike ride which helps her talk about what is bothering her. 'She also loves dancing and singing which is how she expresses herself. 'She's also joined the theatre which has boosted her confidence.' Lauren gives advice to children with visible differences who are being bullied. Lauren says that Myah has struggled with confidence in expressing herself but now is teaching her to become more independent 'The most important thing is to talk about your feelings, if someone has upset you', said Lauren. 'It was only when we both talked about what was going on that things started getting better.' Lauren says the biggest benefit is communicating, as Myah started feeling better when she talked about what was happening. 'Get them to talk, sit down one-on-one and talk about what is happening', said Lauren. 'She has a counsellor to support her, and a community of support through her fundraiser. But mostly it's just me and her and my close friends. Her mother, Lauren, said more needs to be done to change the way people treat people with visible differences.

(AP) \u2014 More than 10 months after the Reyna family pressured U.S. Soccer Federation staff to give more playing time to Gio Reyna at the World Cup, the team has not yet adopted rules to prevent similar lobbying. \u201cThat\u2019s something that U.S. Soccer leadership is discussing, and as of now, nothing\u2019s been put in place,\u201d coach Gregg Berhalter said Monday, a day ahead of the Americans\u2019 exhibition against Ghana. Gio Reyna didn\u2019t play in the Americans\u2019 World Cup opener against Wales on Nov. 21. The following day, the midfielder\u2019s father, former U.S. captain Claudio Reyna, sent a text message to then-USSF sporting director Earnie Stewart, according to a report last March for the federation by the firm Alston and Bird. \u201cWhat a complete and utter \u2026 joke,\u201d Claudio Reyna texted. \u201cOur family is disgusted in case you are wondering. Disgusted at how a coach is allowed to never be challenged and do whatever he wants.\u201d Claudio Reyna sent a text message to then general manager Brian McBride that read: \u201cOur entire family is disgusted, angry, and done with you guys. Don\u2019t expect nice comments from anyone in our family about US Soccer. I\u2019m being transparent to you not like the political clown show of the federation.\u201d The report details complaints from the Reyna family dating to 2016. \u201cWitnesses reported that Mr. Reyna\u2019s past actions involved attempts to influence decisions by U.S. Soccer officials and staff concerning his children on issues ranging from travel arrangements to the impact of on-pitch refereeing decisions,\u201d Alston and Bird wrote. Gio Reyna, a 20-year-old midfielder, made second-half appearances against England and the Netherlands at the World Cup for a total of 53 minutes. Coming back from a fractured leg in June, he played the first half of Saturday\u2019s 3-1 exhibition loss to Germany in his first appearance under Berhalter since the coach was rehired. Berhalter says the family feud is in the past. The coach had said during a management conference after the tournament that he nearly sent a player home from Qatar for lack of effort during training, remarks clearly about Reyna. Claudio Reyna and wife Danielle, a former national team midfielder, contacted the USSF about a three-decades-old domestic violence allegation involving Berhalter and the woman who later became his wife \u2014 Danielle\u2019s former college roommate. Berhalter was replaced by a pair of interim coaches and, after Alston and Bird determined he did not improperly withhold information when he was hired in 2018, Berhalter was rehired to resume coaching in September. A wing midfielder under Berhalter in the past, Reyna played in a central attacking role against Germany, positioned ahead of Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie. Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions. Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. \u201cGio got into some really good positions in his 45 minutes, made some key passes that led to goalscoring opportunities, and that\u2019s something we want to build on,\u201d Berhalter said. The 11th-ranked U.S. has played Ghana three times at the World Cup, getting eliminated with losses in the group stage in 2006 and the round of 16 in 2010, then winning 2-1 in 2014 on John Brooks\u2019 86th-minute goal. The Americans have an automatic berth for the 2026 World Cup as a co-host. The No. 60 Black Stars, who lost to Mexico 2-0 on Saturday, open qualifying next month in a group with the Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Madagascar and Mali. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer Advertisement Advertisement",

The former Wales captain has been in charge of the Canadian men since September 2017. While the Canadian men failed to qualify for the World Cup currently underway in France, Rugby Canada says Jones has widened the depth of the Canadian talent pool and improved collaboration between the Canadian sevens and 15s programs. Jones\u2019 record at the Canadian helm is 15-31-0. \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 16, 2023. Advertisement Advertisement",
