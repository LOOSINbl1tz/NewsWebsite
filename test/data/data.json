A flight from Dubai containing 222 evacuated Australians, including families, landed in Sydney on Tuesday evening. Many were finally able to let their enormous relief and emotions show after fearing for their lives during the last week after terrorist group Hamas brutally attacked Israel. More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, most of them civilians, when militants fired rockets from Gaza then flooded into surrounding settlements. Many passengers repatriated from Israel were finally able to let their emotions show at Sydney airport after fearing for their lives following the Hamas attack.

Pictured: Joyful passengers disembarking at Sydney Emotions ran high as passengers arrive at Sydney International Airport on a DFAT repatriation flight from Israel. Some Australians feared they might never see their loved ones again. Pictured: a woman cries during a family reunion on Tuesday Emotions among reunited families ran high at Sydney airport on Tuesday after the repatriation flight landed. More than 1400 Israelis died during the Hamas attacks A man is overcome with emotion as he embraces a younger relative at Sydney airport on Tuesday. A repatriation flight with 222 people on board landed this evening Some of the passengers were collected from Israel on government flights on Monday. Foreign minister Penny Wong posted to social media that Australia airlifted 194 people from Tel Aviv to Dubai on Monday, including 75 Australians and their families. A further return flight for Australian evacuees is also due to depart London on Tuesday night, Australian time. At least 45 Australians remain trapped in Gaza with limited access to water, electricity, fuel and food after Israel imposed a total blockade on the conflict-stricken territory. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the humanitarian situation in the region was 'dire', with efforts underway for those stranded to be able to cross the border out of Gaza. 'The situation for Australians in Gaza and their families at home is deeply distressing,' she told parliament on Tuesday 'We are doing all we can to support the work of the United States, of Egypt and others to make the Rafah border crossing open for humanitarian purposes, including the passage of civilians. 'Regrettably, efforts to secure passage have not yet been successful, despite many attempts.' Senator Wong said the government was already planning accommodation and onward travel for Australians in Gaza should safe passage through the border crossing be secured. Families were overjoyed to receive their loved one back home safe and sound after the terrifying events in the Middle East in the last week Family members smile as they are welcomed home after arriving at Sydney International Airport on a DFAT repatriation flight The government has previously told citizens to move to the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, in case a humanitarian window opens, but there is no guarantee this will eventuate or how long it might remain open. The foreign minister also confirmed the National Emergency Management Agency had activated plans that would provide assistance to those returning to Australia on the repatriation flights. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia was supporting repatriation efforts for neighbouring nations, coinciding with a visit to Canberra by the Fijian prime minister. 'Australia is playing the role we always play in the Pacific family, to provide support where we can because obviously they don't have the capacity to be able to help their citizens,' he told reporters on Tuesday. 'That is one way Australia is helping not only our own citizens but others as well.' The head of ASIO Mike Burgess said the intelligence organisation warned of possible spontaneous violence following the Middle East conflict. In a press conference alongside FBI director Christopher Wray in the US, Mr Burgess urged political leaders to advocate restraint. 'We, of course, recognise this is a moment that drives feelings and attitudes in our respective countries and in Australia, so we're on the lookout for that as we see protests and counter protests ... but we do anticipate spontaneous violence around these,' he said.

Israel has begun amassing its forces to strike Islamist terrorist group Hamas, after an October 7 attack that has killed more than 1300 people and led to more than 150 being taken hostage, making it the deadliest day in the nation's history. The Israeli Defence Force has retaliated by laying siege to the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza and unleashing a continuous bombing campaign that has killed at least 2750 in the territory. The Gazan civilians have no power, water is scarce and the dwindling fuel sources used for emergency generators could run out within the next day. The United Nations says about one million Gazans have been driven from their homes. More than 1200 Australians have already been evacuated from Israel and Palestine. Australia helped to organise a flight for 194 people from Israel to Dubai on Monday night.

The Swedish activist spoke outside the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel, near Hyde Park, during the start of the Energy Intelligence Forum. The three-day event will see leaders of the world\u2019s and gas giants, including Shell and Total, gather with UK financers and ministers. But Fossil Free London, a group which \u201corganises against fossil fuel companies and their funders\u201d, is set on disrupting what it calls the \u201cOscars of Oil\u201d with its Oily Money Out campaign \u2013 a drive to remove money from the oil industry \u201cfrom our politics and our lives\u201d. Greta, 20, told journalists at the protest: \u201cIt is not a coincidence that we are speeding in the wrong direction. The people in power are knowingly leading us to the end of a precipice. SPONSORED \u201cThey know very well the invaluable things they are sacrificing in order for them to continue squeezing out profits from a dying planet. \u201cWe cannot let this continue. The elites at an oil and money conference have no intention of transition. Their plan is to continue this destructive search for profits. That is why we have to take direct action \u2013 to stop this and to kick oily money out of politics. Activists from Fossil Free London outside the InterContinental in central London \u201cWe have no other option but to put our bodies outside of this conference and physically disrupt.\u201d Five people were arrested on suspicion of obstructing a highway. Fossil Free London has planned three days of protest action against the conference. Director Robin Wells previously said: \u201cThe main purpose of protesting this forum is to make it clear that the industry is not welcome to come to our city, is not welcome to schmooze our politicians, is not welcome to profit at the expense of the collective survival and the health of the one home that we all share.\u201d Police remove an activists during a protest by Fossil Free London in central London The Energy Intelligence Forum describes the event as an opportunity for \u201cdecision-makers, thought-leaders and innovators to debate how a divided world powers the planet in a way that is reliable, affordable and clean\u201d.

The trip aims to highlight the strong partnership between the two countries. This is Putin's first official trip outside of the former Soviet Union since an arrest warrant was issued for him by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in March. However, neither China nor Kyrgyzstan, where Putin visited earlier this month, are members of the ICC. The meeting comes as Western countries criticize China's partnership with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Reuters Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Tuesday to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on a widely watched trip aimed at showcasing the deep mutual trust and \"no-limits\" partnership between China and its giant neighbour. Putin and his entourage flew into the Beijing Capital International Airport on Tuesday morning, according to Reuters video footage, in the Kremlin chief's first official trip outside of the former Soviet Union this year. Putin has travelled little abroad since the Hague-based International Criminal Court ( ICC ) issued an arrest warrant for him in March, accusing him of illegally deporting children from Ukraine. Putin visited Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic, earlier this month. The ICC's move obliges the court's 123 member states to arrest Putin and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory. Neither Kyrgyzstan nor China are members of the ICC, established to prosecute war crimes. Xi last saw his \"dear friend\" in Moscow just days after the warrant was issued. At the time, Xi invited Putin to attend the third Belt and Road forum in Beijing, an international cooperation forum championed by the Chinese leader. Putin will meet with Xi on Wednesday. Beijing has rejected Western criticism of its partnership with Moscow even as the war in Ukraine showed no sign of ceasing, insisting that their ties do not violate international norms, and China has the right to collaborate with whichever country it chooses. Putin last visited China for the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022 when Russia and China declared a \"no-limits\" partnership days before the Russian president sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. It would be Putin's third attendance of the Belt and Road Forum, which runs through Wednesday. He attended the two previous forums in 2017 and 2019.

The agreement sets up the 27-country European Union to be one of the most ambitious negotiators at the annual United Nations climate talks, where nearly 200 countries negotiate efforts to fight global warming. \"We will be at the forefront of the negotiations to show the EU's strongest commitment to the green transition and encourage our partners to follow our lead,\" Spain's Climate Minister Teresa Ribera said. A central decision will be whether countries at the COP, which begins on Nov. 30 in Dubai, agree for the first time to phase out fossil fuels. Burning coal, oil and gas produces greenhouse gases that are the main cause of climate change. The EU's 27 member countries agreed unanimously to call at COP28 for a phase-out of \"unabated\" fossil fuels. That leaves a window for countries to keep burning coal, gas and oil if they use technology to \"abate\" - meaning capture - the resulting emissions. However, the EU deal noted that emissions capturing technologies \"exist at limited scale and are to be used to reduce emissions mainly from hard to abate sectors\". The use of these technologies \"should not be used to delay climate action\", said the deal, seen by Reuters. Denmark's global climate minister, Dan Jorgensen, said the negotiating position was \"extremely ambitious\". \"I would have liked it to be even more ambitious, but okay, we are a union for almost 30 countries, and we need to agree,\" he told Reuters. Around 10 countries including Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Slovenia had wanted a stronger deal to phase out all fossil fuels. However, a similar number of countries - including Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Malta and Poland - successfully argued for the caveat on abatement technologies. Bulgaria's Environment Minister Julian Popov told Reuters the aim was to keep open this option for polluting sectors with limited technologies to cut emissions - such as chemicals and cement manufacturing - but not for the energy sector, where the shift to low-carbon sources like wind and solar is already underway. \"It's a very expensive technology, it's not sufficiently developed. So if we have to invest and focus in (carbon capture technology), we have to find the right sector for it,\" he said. The EU split reflects simmering global tensions. EU countries opposing a full phase-out include poorer nations who fear the impact of weaning their economies off fossil fuels. Fossil fuel producers and consumers - some of whom, like Saudi Arabia, have blocked attempts to agree a phase-out in meetings including this year's G20 summit - are expected to offer similar resistance at the COP28 summit. EU countries also called for \"inefficient\" fossil fuel subsidies to be phased out by 2030, and said there could be no new coal-fuelled power plants if the world is to avert severe climate change.

An inspection team recently visited Helsby High School and described it as a \u201cwelcoming school\u201d, with 1,331 pupils on the school roll. Inspectors noted: \"Leaders have crafted a broad and ambitious curriculum for all pupils, including those with special education needs and/or disabilities (SEND). Leaders have successfully increased the uptake of the English Baccalaureate suite of subjects. Students in the sixth form have access to a range of qualifications that suit their interests.\" Helsby High School is celebrating a Good report from Ofsted inspectors. Helsby High said that the report matched its own self-evaluation in terms of areas of strength and the areas for development which they have already been working on. Identifying where the school can improve further, inspectors said: \"Leaders should support teachers to design learning opportunities that help pupils know and remember more\", and should \"implement the new phonics programme to help pupils catch up quickly with their reading\". In response to the report, headteacher Martin Hill said: \"Young people today often come in for much criticism and so what genuinely pleases us the most is the recognition that our students receive in the report.\" Helsby High School is celebrating a Good report from Ofsted inspectors. Inspectors noted, for children at the school: \u201cPupils value the friendships that they forge with their classmates. They feel happy and enjoy their learning. \u201cPupils enjoy developing their talents in athletics, netball and football. They relish the opportunities to perform for others through the choir and drama clubs. \"Pupils behave well in the classroom and at social times. Sixth form students are polite and well mannered. They are keen to learn and do well. \u201cPupils, including students in the sixth form, have opportunities to serve their community. For example, the \u2018Snow Angel\u2019 pupil group support the elderly. Pupils take joy in fundraising and helping others, such as through the Christmas Hamper collection. This helps prepare pupils for life beyond school.\u201d Helsby High School is celebrating a Good report from Ofsted inspectors.
