Strategists warn, however, that his re-election may depend more on domestic issues like the economy. Mr. Biden's polling numbers have been mired in dangerous territory since he oversaw the chaotic American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The enactment of popular legislation on infrastructure and renewable energy investments has done little to improve his popularity. A White House push to promote economic improvements under the banner of \"Bidenomics\" has done little to convince voters of its merits. \"I don't anticipate any long-term benefits politically,\" Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University, said of Mr. Biden's handling of the war in Israel. \"We live in an era now where polarization is so deep that no matter what the magnitude of the crisis is, or the performance of the president, it's not likely to make a difference.\" Several voters interviewed on Friday were skeptical of Mr. Biden's call to send $14 billion to help Israel — let alone another $60 billion for Ukraine. Samantha Moskowitz, 27, a psychology student at Georgia Gwinnett College in the Atlanta suburbs, said the prospect of sending billions to Israel and Ukraine \"makes me anxious, especially where our economy is right now.\" \"I don't love the idea that the money is being sent,\" said Ms. Moskowitz, who did not vote for either Mr. Biden or Donald J. Trump in 2020 and said it was \"too early to tell\" if she would vote in 2024. \"There is a need, but do we really need that significant amount?\" She said she did not watch Mr. Biden's Oval Office address on Thursday. About 20.3 million people watched Mr. Biden's speech across 10 television networks, according to preliminary data from Nielsen. The total audience for the speech was certainly bigger, given that the Nielsen data does not capture some online viewing numbers. When Mr. Trump spoke about immigration from the Oval Office in January 2019, about 40 million people tuned in. Just over 27 million people watched Mr. Biden's State of the Union speech in February.
